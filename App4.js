    <p>Fisher Space Pen is proud to introduce the first pen that embodies everything tough, demanding, and durable that firefighters stand for with the non-reflective matte black Cap-O-Matic featuring a red line printed down the face of the clip and the barrel of the pen.

    Fisher Space has several models of pens that they consider to be the "backbone" of their business. While the AG7, Bullet and Shuttle series have always been the stars of the stories, the classic Cap-O-Matic Space Pen has truly been the blue-collar workhorse of the bunch. Single hand activation makes this model the pen of choice for construction crews, law enforcement, firefighters, military, first responders, medical professionals, outdoorsmen and women and anyone who demands dependability in their writing instruments. The non-reflective matte black powder coat finish is durable and aesthetically appealing to the eye. The creation of the Cap-O-Matic allowed Fisher Space Pen to offer the same technology used by astronauts, with single hand activation at a price everyone can afford!</p>
